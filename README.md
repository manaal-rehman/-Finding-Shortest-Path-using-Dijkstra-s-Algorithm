# -Finding-Shortest-Path-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm

In this project we were required to implement the Dijkstra's Algorithm which is a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm for finding shortest path from a starting vertex to every other vertex in the graph. I made this project in C by using a directed weighted graph represented by an Adjacency Matrix.
